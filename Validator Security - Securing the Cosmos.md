Validators 
- Block Reward in proportioin to stake 
- Transaction Fees
- More Stake == more power
- Governance


Benefits to running a validator
- Pretty cheap to do!

Validator Networks:
- Cosmos
- Kava
- Polkadot
- Microtick

Cosmos - "The internet of block-chains"

Cosmos ATOM 

Staking w/a validator 

Why should I risk my $$$
- Block rewards - inflation on native tokens incentivize holders to bond their stake as non-bonded
  stake will be diluted over time 
- In Aug 2020, Cosmos ATOM had a 7% inflation, and staked coins received 9.7% return 
- Transaction Feeds: Bonus on the fees of the proposed block

Slashing 
- Slashing is a violation to the network and consensus layer 
- Jeopardizes the safety of other participants 
- Financial incentive to "play nice"

Slashing Events 
- Downtime - If you miss 95% of the last 10,000 blocks, then you get slashed 

Double Sign
- Private key from a validator was used to sign two transactions... 
- When that was detected, the validator was jailed. 


Best Practices for Staking with a Validator
- Who do you trust with your money?
- Diversify (3 or more)
- Look at their uptime history
- Jail occurances?
- Redundant setup?
- Team profile and communication?
