1.) How many coins do you have?
- Wallet asks the question to the larger cloud...

We trust Node software, libraries and infra not to drop modify, or craft transactions to steal funds

- Devs could be attacked 



BGP network was hijacked to eclipse attack Doge and Bitcoin miner pools

EOS Node code execution vuln. (the first of many hahaha)

Monero - 2019
- Monero Website compromised to serve backdoored client (wallet) stealing funds

Ravencoin 
- Inflation Bug exploited 300M RVN minted

2.) Breaking the nodes

Out of Scope Attacks:
- Consensus Mechanisms, 51% attacs, reorgs, protocol design issue
- Key Mgmgt - handling key material outside of node software
- Incorrect usage - not understanding protocol quireks such as Ripple's tfPartialPayment
- Smart Contacts: Layer 2 vulns in Smart contracts, defi, etc...

In Scope: 
- Implementation - Protocol, software flaws, attack resilience
- Infrastructure - Underlying OS, network stack
- Management - Access management, configuration, source control

What's A threat Model?
- Process to identify potential threats, assess their risk, and prioritize mitigations
- [OWASP Theat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html)

Attack Surface:
- Sum of different attack vectors with a threat agent can interact with an environment with 

Threat Agent: 
- An entity that can manifest a threat
